# ClassroomTracking - Ver. 0.1
## Introduction

This is the very first version of a classroom activity tracking app that Professor Richard Gessner (UCSD) and I collaborated to develop. It serves the need to:
1. Track the location of the lecturer with respect to the classroom;
2. Locate the speaker in the classroom (i.e. lecturer or student);
3. Provide insight into the movement of the lecturer and his/her proximity to the speaker of the classroom at a given time.
The project is still in infant phase and not ready to deploy yet, But a mock version has been provided to test the location tracking concept. The project will continue to evolve during spring and summer 2020, and also may migrate to iOS.

## Equipment

Two Eddiestone URL becons will be placed at the two front-corners of the classroom. In ver. 0.1 there is a random signal generator and mock beacon that replace this part.
